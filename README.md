# Encrypted, github-hosted Tiddly Wiki

Experiment of hosting a client-side encrypted single-html wiki as github page.

This uses [TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5), and a nifty custom 404.html page copied from [spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).

It allows locally modifying the wiki in the browser, then adding and pushing to github, then viewing the content via github pages.
Obviously it does not allow modifying the contents when viewing as github pages (cannot save).
