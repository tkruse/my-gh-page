# Github hosted private notebook

This is an encrypted, github-hosted [Tiddly Wiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5), to hide my secrets in plain sight.

It allows locally modifying the wiki in the browser, then adding and pushing to github, then viewing the content via github pages.
Obviously it does not allow modifying the contents when viewing as github pages (cannot save).
